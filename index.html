            <p>Hi! My name is Edwin Rene Rodriguez Ortiz, and I am from Queretaro México, I like learning web
                development
                and I
                hope I can make a lot of good friends on this course. I enjoy watching movies and the nature, I'm also
                married to a beautiful woman, we have three kids, my eldest is a girl, she is twelve years old, the one
                in
                the middle is a boy, he's ten and my youngest is also a girl but she's is seven, next December she'll
                turn
                eight. I'm currently working at a call center but I'm hoping that by the beginning of the next year I'll
                be
                working in web development or something related to programming.</p>
            <p>During my formative years we lived indifferent parts of México, and albeit being difficult to adapt every
                once in a while to a new environment, now that I think of it, I think it help me to learn to adapt to
                the
                changes, since I had to accept them and live with them, I made some good friend when I was a teenager
                and
                although I lost contact with most of them, their memories remain with me and I treasure those moments
                when I
                come back to them. I hope I can become a good programmer, I know I'm still not to good at it but I know
                if I
                keep my faith in our Savior Jesus Christ and If I continue making my part, I'll succeed in it. </p>
